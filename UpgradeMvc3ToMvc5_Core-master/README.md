UpgradeMvc3ToMvc5_Core
========================

Upgrades an MVC3 project to MVC5, only adding only core MVC5 components (No OAuth, etc). This package is based on a package created by Nandip Makwana (http://www.dotnetexpertguide.com/2013/02/aspnet-mvc-auto-upgrade-mvc-3-to-mvc-4-application.html). It was modified to support MVC5 and fix a few other issues.
